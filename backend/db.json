Bonus attributes, displayed by both of the initial responding officers (the mustached one and the bald one that joins in) is a total unwillingness to even entertain anything Peter is saying and a nasty mean streak. They talk over this poor fella, repeating their nonsense over and over, drowning out anything he says, even when he clearly states he does not understand the words they are using. It's baffling how fast this hairless swine goes on the offensive, aggressively trying to overpower a confused man who is trying to be left alone. This man has done nothing wrong. The excuse used to extract his information is that Peter was supposedly tresspassed. There is no evidence of nay of this. At no point have we seen or heard a McDonald's employee tell either the victim or the 'perps' that a tresspass was to be issued. When cops make this type of decision on their own, try to force unlawful conduct upon innocent ppl and end up killing them, maybe it's time to stop and think about what the actual fuck is happening. \n\nHonestly, as a european citizen i'm appalled by this type of thing and by the sheer number of comparable incidents. To protect and serve was it? Law enforcement in the USA is a joke. And not a funny one at that. What a nightmare.",

You can clearly see the tyrant grab the man by the neck, deliberately squeezing to inflict pain, knowing that it forces the victim to pull away, which is exactly the reaction the tyrant wanted the public to see, making it look like he’s resisting instead of just reacting to being hurt. That is all the victim was doing, let’s be clear about that.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t about letting him go after a simple detainment and ID check, as the tyrant would say and try to have you believe you know that would be his go to line that he would then use.\r\n\r\n“If he had just complied, I was simply going to detain him while I ran his name. The cuffs can come off as quick as they went on, he wasn’t being arrested, it was just a detainment.”\r\n\r\nThe tyrant escalated it unnecessarily. Watch closely he even looks around to see if anyone is watching, then when he possibly realizes what he’s doing with people potentially watching, he pauses for a moment like he knows that he has no valid reason for what he’s doing, and then he stops. He resumes once backup arrives because he just can’t resist himself, and now he also has another officer who could justify what he’s doing. That’s not justice, that’s abuse of power, and it cost a man his life. That’s murder.!\r\n\r\nThey beat him for nothing, making it seem like he’s reaching for something, when it was the second tyrant who was holding his arm where it was, and also because the tyrant couldn’t do what the first tyrant was doing with the arm lock, so he resorted to a violent attack, trying to justify it with “oh, he’s reaching,” which is what tyrant number 1 said. The victim only pulled his hands straight up to his face to shield himself from these animals because he probably felt what was coming. THAT WAS ALL HE DID, and sure enough, what he thought was coming did, they beat him protecting his face.\r\n\r\nIf there was any police involvement, it should have been a simple trespass and “have a good day.” But let’s be real it shouldn’t have even been that!",

Bonus attributes, displayed by both of the initial responding officers (the mustached one and the bald one that joins in) is a total unwillingness to even entertain anything Peter is saying and a nasty mean streak. They talk over this poor fella, repeating their nonsense over and over, drowning out anything he says, even when he clearly states he does not understand the words they are using. It's baffling how fast this hairless swine goes on the offensive, aggressively trying to overpower a confused man who is trying to be left alone. This man has done nothing wrong. The excuse used to extract his information is that Peter was supposedly tresspassed. There is no evidence of nay of this. At no point have we seen or heard a McDonald's employee tell either the victim or the 'perps' that a tresspass was to be issued. When cops make this type of decision on their own, try to force unlawful conduct upon innocent ppl and end up killing them, maybe it's time to stop and think about what the actual fuck is happening. \n\nHonestly, as a european citizen i'm appalled by this type of thing and by the sheer number of comparable incidents. To protect and serve was it? Law enforcement in the USA is a joke. And not a funny one at that. What a nightmare.",
